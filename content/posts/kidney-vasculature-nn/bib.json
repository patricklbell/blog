    "abstract": "Many hyperparameters have to be tuned to have a robust convolutional neural network that will be able to accurately classify images. One of the most important hyperparameters is the batch size, which is the number of images used to train a single forward and backward pass. In this study, the effect of batch size on the performance of convolutional neural networks and the impact of learning rates will be studied for image classification, specifically for medical images. To train the network faster, a VGG16 network with ImageNet weights was used in this experiment. Our results concluded that a higher batch size does not usually achieve high accuracy, and the learning rate and the optimizer used will have a significant impact as well. Lowering the learning rate and decreasing the batch size will allow the network to train better, especially in the case of fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "In tropical and subtropical countries with bad infrastructure there exists diseases which are often neglected and untreated. Some of these diseases are caused by parasitic intestinal worms which most often affect children severely. The worms spread through parasite eggs in human stool that end up in arable soil and drinking water. Over one billion people are infected with these worms, but medication is available. The problem is the ineffective diagnostic method hindering the medication to be distributed effectively. In the process of designing an automated microscope for increased effectiveness the solution for marking out the stool sample on the microscope slide is important for decreasing the time of diagnosis. This study examined the active contour model and four different semantic segmentation networks for the purpose of delineating the stool sample from the other parts of the microscope slide. The Intersection-over-Union (IoU) measurement was used to measure the performance of the models. Both active contour and the networks increased the IoU compared to the current implementation. The best model was the FCN-32 network which is a fully convolutional network created for semantic segmentation tasks. This network had an IoU of 95.2",

    "abstract": "Several ongoing international efforts are developing methods of localizing single cells within organs or mapping the entire human body at the single cell level, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and the Knut and Allice Wallenberg Foundation’s Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and the National Institutes of Health’s Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). Their goals are to understand cell specialization, interactions, spatial organization in their natural context, and ultimately the function of every cell within the body. In the same way that the Human Genome Project had to assemble sequence data from different people to construct a complete sequence, multiple centers around the world are collecting tissue specimens from diverse populations that vary in age, race, sex, and body size. A challenge will be combining these heterogeneous tissue samples into a 3D reference map that will enable multiscale, multidimensional Google Maps-like exploration of the human body. Key to making alignment of tissue samples work is identifying and using a coordinate system called a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), which defines the positions, or “addresses,” in a reference body, from whole organs down to functional tissue units and individual cells. In this perspective, we examine the concept of a CCF based on the vasculature and describe why it would be an attractive choice for mapping the human body.",
